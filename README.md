# Natural Language Processing Project day 2

NLP is one of the components of Artificial intelligence which is the ability of a computer program to understand the human speech.

Now, let's dig deep to learn how we can make a fully fledged model to understand textual data.

## What have we learnt so far

In today's lecture we learned some of the core concepts invloved in Natural language processing such as :-
- POS Tagging
- Chunking
- Parsing
- Topic Modeling

## Why solve this assignment?

Lets review some of the concepts taught in the class. At the end of the assignment you'll be able to:

* Implement a topic modelling from scratch 
* Use Count Vectorizer to implement topic modelling 
* Write a generic helper function which will output the topics modelled using CountVectorizer to get the number of words for each topic.

## Dataset

For this exercise, we will use the sessions Data Set,which comprises the title of talks given at a conference.
